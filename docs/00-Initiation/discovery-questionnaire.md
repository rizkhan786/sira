# Discovery Questionnaire - SIRA

## Project Identity
**Project Name:** SIRA (Self-Improving Reasoning Agent)

**One-Line Vision:** An AI agent that continuously improves its reasoning capabilities through self-reflection and learning from its own problem-solving patterns.

## Problem & Solution
**What problem are we solving?**
Current LLMs do not learn from their reasoning process or improve their problem-solving strategies over time. Each query is treated independently without building upon previous successful reasoning patterns or self-correcting failed approaches.

**Who experiences this problem?**
- AI researchers exploring reasoning capabilities
- Developers building complex AI applications
- Power users working with advanced problem-solving tasks
- Organizations requiring transparent, improving AI reasoning

**What is the desired outcome?**
An AI agent that:
- Learns from its own reasoning successes and failures
- Improves answer quality through iterative self-reflection
- Maintains a knowledge base of effective reasoning patterns
- Demonstrates measurable improvement over time
- Provides transparency into its reasoning process

## Core Capabilities
1. Multi-step reasoning with chain-of-thought
2. Self-verification of reasoning quality
3. Learning mechanism to store successful patterns
4. Iterative refinement through multiple passes
5. Knowledge persistence across sessions
6. Performance metrics tracking

## Success Criteria
- Answer accuracy improves measurably over time
- Reasoning depth and quality increase
- Pattern reuse rate demonstrates learning
- Self-correction frequency indicates maturity
- User satisfaction with reasoning transparency
